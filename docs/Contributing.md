# Constributing


## Bugs:

If you have encountered a bug, please write an issue to report it.  
The issue should include your configuration file and the error 
you have encountered or the expected behavior.

## Feature requests:

Simply open an issue starting with `[FEATURE]` and explain the feature you'd like to see.

## Feature implementations:

Thank you for wanting to help in the development of dynpaper. If you 'd like to implement a feature 
but don't have anything in your mind, feel free to checkout `projects` tab. If you have a feature in mind and
you'd like to implement it, please open an issue explaining the feature and we will discuss it. If I believe
the feature is unnecessary I will probably refrain from adding it even if you've made a pull request so please
write an issue so you won't waste your time.

## Forking

If you dislike the direction the project is going, just fork and move on your own, it's BSD licensed afterall.
